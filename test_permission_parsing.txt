This is a test file to verify permission prompt parsing.

The improved regex should now:
1. Find permission anchor keywords
2. Extract consecutive numbered lists
3. Validate with permission keywords (approve, deny, allow, yes, no)
4. Return the FIRST matching group (not last)
5. Handle both 2-option and 3-option prompts
