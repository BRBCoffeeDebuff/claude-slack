Testing option 1 reconstruction

Changes made:
1. Increased buffer from 1KB to 4KB (more capacity)
2. Added logic to detect when options start with 2 or 3
3. Prepends "Approve this time" when option 1 is missing
4. Handles both missing option 1 and missing options 1+2

Expected result: Slack message should show all 3 options even if buffer only has 2 & 3
